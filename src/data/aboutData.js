const about = "This project is inspired by a hack-a-thon that my team and I totally failed on during my time at BrainStation. We had about 10 hours to work with the Data Science and UX/UI Design teams to create an app from scratch and due to too many amazing ideas, we just didn't have the time to finish. The original project was meant to be a map of Canada and provide province specific details when clicked. However, I have changed this concept to one that is close to my heart, tourism in Ecuador."
